I have solved the problem using recursive method. The user inputs the *main article, depth and number of links* as arguments from the command line.

The output is the tree structure of links and sublinks.

- Input: 
    <pre> python3 viomba.py Physics 2 3 </pre>
- Output:
<pre>
Physics 
   Natural science 
     Branches of science
     Science

   Matter 
     Classical physics
     Chemistry
     Mass
   Elementary particle 
     Particle physics
     Subatomic particle
     Electron
